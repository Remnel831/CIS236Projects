	<H1>Hello!</H1>	
	</br>
	<H2>My name is Jacob and this is my introduction page.</H2>	</br>
		<h3>My favorite culture I'm not native to is:</h3>
			<p>Ancient Greece!  I had a ton of books growing up that were just the history and mythology and I read them constantly.</p>
		</br>
		<h3>Two figures I relate/look up to:</h3>
			<p>I'd say first John Carmack for his work ethic as well as all the crazy stuff he's pioneered in general, but specifically the work he's done with 3d rendering and texturing.</p>
			<p>Second would have to be Gary Gygax.  I've made a ton of friends and good memories through Dungeons and Dragons and none of that would've been possible without him!</p>
							<!--Imagine the dark timeline where my friends and I had play Shadowrun instead and were destroyed by its labyrinthine math systems-->
		</br>
		<h3>a meal that represents me is:</h3>
			<p>Homemade chicken dumpling soup! I've got a recipe that I've been perfecting for years now.</p>
		</br>
		<h3>I feel most creative when:</h3>
			<p>I'm listening to music. I've got a big playlist of mashups I found that I throw on whenever I get to work on things.</p>
